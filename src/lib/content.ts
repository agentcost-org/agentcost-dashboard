    excerpt:
      "A single, exportable report that opens with a one-glance executive summary and continues into deep breakdowns — latency percentiles, cost concentration, error analysis, usage cadence, and savings — across any time range.",

      "Your dashboard answers questions live, one panel at a time. But when finance asks 'what did we spend last month, and why?', or a customer wants a usage summary, you need a single document you can read top to bottom — or hand to someone who will. That document is the new Executive Report.",
      "Every report opens with an executive summary: total spend, calls, tokens, success rate, average latency, and projected monthly run-rate — each with a period-over-period delta against the immediately preceding window of equal length, so a 30-day report compares against the 30 days before it. The headline is the part anyone can read; everything below it is for the people who need the detail.",
      "And there is a lot of detail. Latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), not just averages — because averages hide the tail that actually pages your on-call. Cost concentration, showing how few models drive most of your spend (the classic Pareto split). Token efficiency, with blended cost per 1K tokens and your input-to-output ratio per model. A reliability section that breaks failures down by model and lists your most frequent errors verbatim. A usage cadence view that surfaces your busiest day and hour. And an optimization-savings rollup that ties straight back to the recommendations engine.",
      "It runs over any window: the standard presets, month-to-date, or a fully custom start-and-end date range for billing-aligned reporting. Two export paths ship with it. PDF renders a clean, letterheaded document — not a screenshot of the dashboard, but a purpose-built page with its own typography, KPI grid, tables, and inline charts, so it prints the same on every machine. CSV exports the raw breakdown tables (models, agents, errors, cadence) with a UTF-8 byte-order mark so currency symbols and accented text open correctly in Excel on the first try.",
      "You will find it in the dashboard sidebar under Reports. It works against your live data, and it works in the no-signup demo too — open the demo, pick a range, and export a sample report to see exactly what your finance team would receive.",

      "Stop surprise bills with project-level monthly budgets, threshold alerts, and hard-cap enforcement — now with real-time in-app and email notifications.",

      "Observability tells you what happened. Governance tells you what should not happen. Until this release, AgentCost only solved the first half.",
      "Budget Guardrails close the loop. Every project can now define a monthly USD budget, a list of alert thresholds (defaults: 50%, 80%, 100%), and one of three enforcement modes: off, warn, or hard cap. In warn mode, owners and project admins receive an in-app notification and an email the first time each threshold is crossed in a calendar month — deduplicated so a noisy ingestion batch can not trigger repeat alerts. In hard cap mode, the ingestion endpoint returns 429 once month-to-date spend reaches the budget, protecting you from runaway agents and broken loops in production.",
      "Thresholds are evaluated on every event batch, against month-to-date cost in UTC. The projected spend (current spend + the incoming batch) is what gets compared, so a single large batch that would push you across the cap is rejected before it is persisted, not after. The deduplication is enforced at the database layer with a unique index on (project_id, period_key, threshold_percent), so a restarted worker or a retried batch can not double-alert.",
      "On the dashboard side, the new Budget Guardrails card in Settings shows month-to-date spend, a utilization bar that changes color as you approach the cap, the configured thresholds as chips you can add or remove, and the enforcement mode as a single dropdown. The new bell icon in the top-right of every dashboard page surfaces budget alerts (and any future user-scoped notifications) with a live unread count.",
      "If you have not set a budget yet, nothing changes — the feature is opt-in per project. To enable it, head to Settings → Budget Guardrails and pick the mode that fits your environment. Most teams start in warn mode for a billing cycle, then promote to hard cap once they trust the threshold values.",

      "Most production LLM stacks are not single-provider. A typical setup calls OpenAI for chat, Anthropic for long-context reasoning, and routes some workflows through LangChain. Fragmented per-provider dashboards make it hard to answer the basic question: which model is actually costing us money this week?",
      "The AgentCost SDK now instruments all three paths through a single import. No wrappers, no decorators, no proxy URLs — lightweight interception attaches to the provider clients you already use and reports usage, tokens, and cost in a normalized schema.",

    date: "2026-09-05",
    summary:
      "Guardrail compliance, a redesigned documentation site, a colour-blind-safe chart palette, and a rebuilt landing page",
    changes: [
      "New Guardrails page: declare a boundary per agent — which tools it may call, whether it is read-only, which models it may use, and how many tool calls or how much cost a single run may reach — and see per agent whether observed usage stayed inside it: every breach, the tool, model or run that crossed the line, and how much of the agent's work it represents. Opening an agent shows what it actually used — every tool with call counts, every model with cost, and the p50, p95 and max tool calls and cost per run — so a limit can be set from observed behaviour with one click. Kept separate from success rate on purpose: that measures whether calls raised, this measures whether agents stayed inside the line you drew.",
      "Breach alerts: a breach raises a notification for the project owner and admins and fires a signed guardrail.breach webhook where one is configured, with repeats of the same breach suppressed for an hour so a looping agent produces one alert, not thousands. Per-run limits are judged on the run's running total, so a run that crosses the line across several batches still alerts.",
      "Agents and Settings pages rebuilt in one quieter vocabulary — a single stat band instead of icon cards, hairline tables, and settings laid out as labelled rows — and the Agents table now shows each agent's guardrail status.",
      "Landing page: the hero now puts the release announcement beside the headline instead of above it, and the five sourced cost stories are shown as one strip with the figure first.",
      "SDK 0.2.2: track_costs.tool() now records the tool name outside a workflow() too, so tool boundaries are visible without declaring a run. Inside a workflow nothing changes.",
      "Documentation rebuilt as a three-column site: persistent navigation, Ctrl+K search across every page and endpoint, an on-this-page outline, a copy-page button, previous/next paging and a per-page helpfulness vote. Every page moved onto shared components so headings, code blocks, callouts and endpoint entries look the same everywhere.",
      "Model catalogue page: announced retirements are listed with days remaining, a one-click filter narrows the catalogue to every retiring model, and the provider and type filters are now proper dark menus with type-to-filter.",
      "Charts and reports share one colour-blind-safe palette — cost, calls and tokens keep the same colour on every chart, in the PDF report and in the OpenAI import — and the accent colour reverted from blue to neutral throughout the app.",
      "Landing page: a capability walkthrough that shows the product itself in miniature for each feature, and a privacy section that plays the exact fields an event carries, each opening into where its value comes from and what it can reveal, with the list of everything that never leaves your process.",
      "API Reference and the published OpenAPI specification cover the guardrail endpoints and the docs-feedback endpoint; the Data & Privacy page notes that tool() outside a workflow sends the tool name alone.",

    summary:
      "Workflow tracing, cost per completed outcome, a pre-deployment analyser, and classification-workload detection",
    changes: [
      "Added workflow tracing to the SDK: wrap a multi-step run in track_costs.workflow() and its calls in step() or tool(), and every event records where it sat in that run. Works across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and LangChain, including streamed calls.",
      "New Workflows page showing cost per run rather than per call, cost per step and per tool, and a distribution chart of what a single run actually costs — with the most expensive 5% of runs and their share of spend called out, because an average hides the runs worth finding.",
      "Repeated-work detection: identical calls made more than once inside a single run. This is distinct from the duplicate calls a cache fixes — within one run it usually means the control flow is looping.",
      "Added cost per completed outcome. Call track_costs.outcome(success, label=...) and the dashboard reports what a result costs, charging failed runs to the successes they were paid for. Runs that report nothing are counted as unreported, never as failures.",
      "New agentcost analyze command estimates what an agent will cost before it has spent anything: it token-counts your prompt and skill files, projects a recorded local-mode test run to production volume, and flags looping steps, repeated calls, oversized prompts and duplicated context. It runs entirely on your machine and transmits nothing — use --fail-on high to block a deploy in CI.",
      "Optimizations now detect classification-shaped workloads: agents whose responses are always short and whose inputs repeat are doing work a smaller model, a trained classifier, or a lookup would do far more cheaply. Detected from token counts alone, without reading any prompt.",
      "Documented the full trace and outcome payloads on the Data & Privacy Architecture page, including that workflow, step, tool and label names are strings you write and are transmitted as written.",
      "Every workflow endpoint is documented in the API Reference, and none of this changes existing events: without a workflow() the SDK emits exactly what it did before.",

      "Instant onboarding: signing up now auto-creates a project with an API key, so you can go from register to tracked calls without any manual setup.",
      "Added OpenAI 30-day spend import so new accounts see real historical spend immediately after connecting.",
