    title: "AgentCost — LLM cost tracking for agents",
    description:
      "Track OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and LangChain spend in real time, attributed to the agent that caused it. Free hosted cloud, MIT-licensed stack.",
    section: "Product",
    body: `AgentCost records every LLM call your application makes — model, tokens, cost,
latency and status — and attributes it to the agent, workflow and project that
caused it. It answers the question a provider dashboard cannot: which part of my
system is expensive, and what would be cheaper?

## Quick start

Install the Python SDK and add two lines. Existing LangChain, OpenAI and
Anthropic code runs unchanged — the SDK intercepts calls by monkey-patching the
provider client, so there is no refactoring.

\`\`\`bash
pip install agentcost
\`\`\`

\`\`\`python
import agentcost
agentcost.init(api_key="sk_your_project_key")
\`\`\`

## What it gives you

- **Per-agent attribution** — wrap a block with \`track_costs.agent("planner")\` and every call inside it is billed to that agent.
- **Workflow and trace analysis** — step costs, repeated work and per-run totals across multi-step agents.
- **Budget guardrails** — monthly project budgets with threshold alerts, and an optional hard cap that rejects ingestion with a 429 once the budget is reached.
- **Guardrail compliance** — declare per agent whether it is read-only and which tools it may call; the dashboard reports breaches per agent from observed tool usage and alerts on them, kept separate from success rate.
- **Optimization recommendations** — cheaper-model suggestions and caching opportunities derived from your own traffic, with effectiveness tracked after you apply them.
- **Executive reports** — a board-ready PDF or CSV over any date range.
- **A public model catalogue** — 3,500+ models across 50+ providers with per-1k input, output and cached rates, synced from LiteLLM.

## Cost

Free. The hosted cloud has no tiers, seat limits or usage caps, and the whole
stack is MIT-licensed, so you can self-host the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL
on your own infrastructure instead. In self-hosted mode nothing leaves your
environment and there is no telemetry or phone-home behaviour.

## Stack

Backend: Python, FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL. Frontend: Next.js,
React, Tailwind CSS. SDK: Python, using tiktoken for token counting and httpx
for async delivery.`,

- **Hosted cloud** — sign up and use it. No usage limits, no tiers, and no premium features behind a paywall. Events are stored at ${API_URL}, and you can delete your data or your account at any time.
- **Self-hosted** — the same stack is MIT-licensed. Run the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL with Docker on your own infrastructure. Nothing leaves your environment and there is no telemetry.

There is no paid plan, and no feature is gated on payment.

If you are weighing AgentCost against a paid platform, the side-by-side pages at
${SITE_URL}/compare cover Helicone, Langfuse and LiteLLM, with each vendor's
pricing read off their own page on a stated date.`,

    description:
      "Index of every AgentCost developer resource: SDK, REST API, CLI, model catalogue, OpenAPI spec and privacy architecture.",
    section: "Documentation",
    body: `## SDK and tooling

- [AgentCost Python SDK](${SITE_URL}/docs/sdk) — install, quick start, configuration, agent tagging, workflows, streaming, local mode.
- [AgentCost CLI reference](${SITE_URL}/docs/cli) — \`agentcost analyze\`, pre-deployment cost estimates, CI usage.
- [AgentCost REST API reference](${SITE_URL}/docs/api) — authentication, endpoints, error format.
- [AgentCost model catalogue](${SITE_URL}/docs/models) — every supported model with live per-token pricing.
- [AgentCost data and privacy architecture](${SITE_URL}/docs/privacy) — exactly what the SDK transmits and what it never collects.

## Machine-readable

- [AgentCost OpenAPI 3.1 specification](${SITE_URL}/openapi.json) — the full API surface. YAML at ${SITE_URL}/api/openapi.yaml.
- [llms.txt](${SITE_URL}/llms.txt) — this site, indexed for agents.
- [llms-full.txt](${SITE_URL}/llms-full.txt) — every public page as one markdown document.
- Public API: ${SITE_URL}/api/v1 (cached mirror) and ${API_URL} (origin).

## Packages

- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/agentcost/
- GitHub: https://github.com/agentcost-ai`,

  {
    route: "/docs/sdk",
    title: "AgentCost Python SDK",
    description:
      "Install the SDK, initialise it with two lines, and every OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and LangChain call is tracked without changing your code.",
    section: "Documentation",
    body: `## Install

\`\`\`bash
pip install agentcost
\`\`\`

## Initialise

\`\`\`python
import agentcost
agentcost.init(api_key="sk_your_project_key")
\`\`\`

That is the whole integration. The SDK monkey-patches the provider clients, so
existing OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and LangChain code is tracked unchanged.

## Attribute costs to an agent

\`\`\`python
with agentcost.track_costs.agent("research-agent"):
    result = llm.invoke(prompt)
\`\`\`

Every call inside the block is attributed to \`research-agent\`, and the dashboard
breaks spend down per agent.

## How it behaves

- **Non-blocking.** Events are batched and delivered asynchronously, so delivery never sits in the path of your LLM call.
- **Local token counting.** Token counts come from tiktoken and cost is a catalogue lookup — neither blocks your application.
- **Local mode.** The SDK can record to disk instead of sending anywhere, for evaluation or air-gapped environments.
- **Workflows and traces.** Multi-step agents can tag workflow and step names, so per-run cost, repeated work and step latency become reportable.

Full reference — configuration, streaming, external correlation, metadata,
event structure, shutdown, error handling and troubleshooting — is at
${SITE_URL}/docs/sdk.`,

    title: "AgentCost REST API",
    description:
      "The AgentCost HTTP API: public model pricing with no credentials, plus authenticated ingestion and analytics. OpenAPI 3.1 spec published.",
    section: "API for agents",
    body: `Origin: ${API_URL}. A cached mirror of the public read endpoints is served from
${SITE_URL}/api/v1 — same paths, same payloads — and the mirror does not sleep,
so it is the better choice for an agent.

Machine-readable specification: ${SITE_URL}/openapi.json (YAML at
${SITE_URL}/api/openapi.yaml).

## Public — no credentials required

- \`GET /v1/health\` — service status and version.
- \`GET /v1/pricing\` — the whole catalogue keyed by model name, with per-1k input, output, cached-input and cache-write rates, provider, modality and any announced retirement date. Optional \`?provider=\` filter.
- \`GET /v1/pricing/{model_name}\` — rates for one model, resolved the same way ingestion resolves them (exact, then deterministic fuzzy). An unknown model returns zeros with \`source: "fallback"\` rather than a 404.
- \`GET /v1/pricing/deprecations\` — active models with an announced retirement date, soonest first.
- \`GET /v1/pricing/sync/status\` — catalogue size, freshness and per-provider counts.
- \`POST /api/v1/estimate\` — cost estimate for a model and a token count. Mirror only.

## Estimate a call before you make it

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST ${SITE_URL}/api/v1/estimate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model": "gpt-4o", "input_tokens": 12000, "output_tokens": 800}'
\`\`\`

Returns the input, output and total cost in USD, the rates used, and the
catalogue entry the model name resolved to.

## Authenticated

Ingestion (\`POST /v1/events/batch\`), analytics, projects, budgets and
optimizations need either a project API key (\`Authorization: Bearer sk_...\`) or
a session token plus a \`project_id\` query parameter.

## Errors

Every error returns JSON with a machine-readable envelope:

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "not_found",
    "message": "human-readable statement of what went wrong",
    "hint": "what to do next",
    "status": 404,
    "docs": "${SITE_URL}/docs/api"

## Connect

Claude Code:

\`\`\`bash
claude mcp add --transport http agentcost ${SITE_URL}/api/mcp

Config-file clients (Claude Desktop and similar):

\`\`\`json
{ "mcpServers": { "agentcost": { "type": "http", "url": "${SITE_URL}/api/mcp" } } }
\`\`\`

## Tools

- **list_models** — search the catalogue by provider and/or name substring, sorted cheapest-input-first. Use it to compare model costs or find a cheaper alternative.
- **get_model_pricing** — per-1,000-token input, output, cached-input and cache-write rates for one named model. Resolves exact, then case-insensitive, then provider-prefixed suffix.
- **estimate_cost** — dollars for a model and a token count, before you spend them. Multiply a single call out to a whole job with \`calls\`.
- **list_model_deprecations** — models with an upstream-announced retirement date, soonest first.

Every tool is read-only and needs no credentials, so they are safe to call
speculatively. They read the public catalogue only — your own spend, projects
and budgets need an authenticated account and the REST API.

    description:
      "How the AgentCost API is versioned, how retirements are signalled with Deprecation and Sunset headers, and the minimum notice before an endpoint stops working.",
    section: "API for agents",
    body: `The API is versioned in the URL path — every endpoint lives under \`/v1/\`,
on both \`${API_URL}/v1/…\` and the cached mirror at \`${SITE_URL}/api/v1/…\`.

Within a version, changes are additive only: new endpoints, new optional request
fields, new response fields. Existing field names keep their meaning and type.
Anything that would break a working client means a new version path. Ignore
response fields you do not recognise.

## How a retirement is announced

Every API response carries a link to the policy:

\`\`\`
Link: <${SITE_URL}/docs/api-versioning>; rel="deprecation"; type="text/html"
\`\`\`

That link alone does NOT mean anything is deprecated. When an endpoint is
actually retiring, its responses additionally carry:

- \`Deprecation\` — a Structured Fields Date (\`@\` plus whole seconds since the epoch) marking when it was announced. The endpoint still works.
- \`Sunset\` — an HTTP-date (RFC 8594) marking when it stops working. Never earlier than the deprecation instant.
- A \`rel="successor-version"\` link to the replacement, where there is one.

Minimum 180 days between the two dates on any public endpoint. The headers are
the notice — no subscription needed.

**Currently deprecated: nothing.** No \`/v1/\` endpoint is deprecated or
scheduled for retirement, so no response carries those headers today.

Provider *model* retirements are a separate feed:
\`GET ${SITE_URL}/api/v1/pricing/deprecations\`.

## What we build

- A Python SDK, published on PyPI as \`agentcost\`, that tracks OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and LangChain calls after a two-line integration.
- A FastAPI backend that ingests those events, prices them against a catalogue of 3,500+ models synced from LiteLLM, and exposes analytics over HTTP.
- A Next.js dashboard for spend breakdowns, budget guardrails, optimization recommendations and executive reporting.
- A command-line analyser, \`agentcost analyze\`, that estimates cost risk in a codebase before it ships.

## How it is licensed

The stack is MIT-licensed and the hosted cloud is free — no tiers, no seat
limits, no usage caps, and no feature held back for a paid plan. You can run the
same code on your own infrastructure with Docker instead; in that mode nothing
leaves your environment and the software does not phone home.

## Who builds it

AgentCost was founded and is maintained by Kushagra Agrawal. Development happens
in the open at https://github.com/agentcost-ai, and the SDK is released to PyPI
at https://pypi.org/project/agentcost/.

## For agents

If you are an agent acting on someone's behalf, you do not need to contact
anyone to use the public API. The model catalogue and the cost estimator are
open at ${SITE_URL}/api/v1, and the specification is at ${SITE_URL}/openapi.json.
