          AgentCost is an LLM cost observability platform. It records every model
          call an application makes and attributes the cost to the agent,
          workflow and project responsible — so a team running multi-agent
          systems can see which part of the system is expensive, not just what
          the monthly provider invoice totals.

        <div className="mt-8 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
          <p>
            Provider dashboards answer &ldquo;what did we spend?&rdquo;. They
            cannot answer &ldquo;which agent spent it, on which step, and would a
            cheaper model have done the same job?&rdquo; — because by the time a
            call reaches OpenAI or Anthropic, every trace of which part of your
            system made it is gone. AgentCost keeps that context at the call site
            and carries it through to the bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the whole product thesis, and it is why the unit of analysis
            here is the agent and the workflow rather than the API key.

            The stack is MIT licensed and the hosted cloud is free. There are no
            tiers, no seat limits, no usage caps, and no feature held back for a
            paid plan. If you would rather not send events anywhere, run the same
            code yourself: the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL start with Docker,
            and in that mode nothing leaves your environment and the software
